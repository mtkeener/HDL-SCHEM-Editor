"""
This class asks for the filename and tries to create an instance object.
If the instance could be created, its symbol is placed into the Canvas.

SymbolReading creates Symbol-Define: Symbol-Define creates SymbolInsertion-Object
                                     Symbol-Define fills Symbol-Insertion-Object
Symbol-Reading fetches reference to the Symbol-Insertion-Object.
Symbol-Reading calls draw-method of Symbol-Insertion-Object.
